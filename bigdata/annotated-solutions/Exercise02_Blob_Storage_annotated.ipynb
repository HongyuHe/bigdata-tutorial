    "SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access Memory) VS. DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Synchronous Operation**:\n",
    "   - SDRAM is synchronized with the computer's bus speed, meaning it operates in sync with the computer's clock speed. This synchronization allows for faster data access and transfer.\n",
    "   - DRAM, on the other hand, is asynchronous and does not synchronize with the computer's clock. This results in a less efficient use of the available bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access Speed and Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - SDRAM is faster and more efficient in terms of accessing and transferring data compared to traditional DRAM. The synchronous nature of SDRAM allows for higher data transfer rates.\n",
    "   - DRAM has slower access times and data transfer rates compared to SDRAM due to its asynchronous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Latency**:\n",
    "   - SDRAM has lower latency compared to DRAM. Latency refers to the time it takes for the memory to respond to a read request. SDRAM's synchronous operation helps in reducing latency.\n",
    "   - DRAM has higher latency due to its asynchronous nature, leading to longer delays in accessing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Burst Mode**:\n",
    "   - SDRAM supports burst mode, where it can transfer multiple data words in a sequence with a single access command. This is more efficient for reading sequential data.\n",
    "   - DRAM does not support burst mode, so each data access requires a separate access command.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Power Consumption**:\n",
    "   - SDRAM typically consumes less power compared to DRAM, making it more energy-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Price and Availability**:\n",
    "   - Historically, SDRAM has been more expensive than DRAM due to its improved performance and features. However, as technology advances and newer generations of memory are introduced, price differences may vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SDRAM offers better performance, lower latency, and higher efficiency compared to DRAM due to its synchronous operation and support for burst mode. However, DRAM is simpler in design and may still be used in applications where performance requirements are not as demanding or where cost considerations are more significant."

    "\n",
    "Since we have arrived at a contradiction, the assumption that both $VC(x) < VC(y)$ and $VC(y) < VC(x)$ are true is invalid. Therefore, the antisymmetry property holds, i.e., if $VC(x) < VC(y)$, then $VC(y) \\nless VC(x)$."
