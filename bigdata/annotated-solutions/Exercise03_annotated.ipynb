    "**Linearly**. HDFS is designed taking machine failure into account, and therefore DataNodes do not need to be (highly expensive) highly reliable machines. Instead standard commodity hardware can be used. Moreover the number of nodes can be increased as soon as it becomes necessary, avoiding wasting of resources when the amount of data is still limited.

    "1. Prior to Hadoop 2.0.0, the **NameNode was a single point of failure**. While the loss of any other machine (intermittently or permanently) does not result in data loss, NameNode loss results in cluster unavailability. The permanent loss of NameNode data would render the cluster's HDFS inoperable.\n",
    "The HDFS High Availability feature addresses the above problems by providing the option of running two redundant NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Secondary NameNode is a node that merges the fsimage and the edits log files periodically and keeps edits log size within a limit. This allows the NameNode to start up faster in case of failure, but the Secondary NameNode is not a redundant NameNode. Over the years, the HDFS team kept improving on the \"alternative\" name nodes and came up almost every year with a new name with new functionality improving on the former ones. In the lecture, we discuss the latest up-to-date variant, standby namenodes, saying all the others (secondary, checkpoint, backup...) are just \"HDFS archeology\".

For each block independently, the HDFS's placement policy is to put one replica on a random node in a random rack, another on one node in a different rack, and the last on a different node in the same rack chosen for the second replica. A possibile configuration is shown in the picture (but there are many more valid solutions).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One could decide to store the 3 replicas in 3 different racks, increasing the expected availability. However this would also slow down the writing process that would involve two inter-rack communications instead of one. Usually, the probability of failure of an entire rack is much smaller than the probability of failure of a node and therefore it is a good tradeoff to have 2/3 of the replicas in one rack.\n",

    "Object storage and block storage are distinct storage paradigms used in computing and data storage systems. Here's a comprehensive list highlighting their key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Unit and Structure**:\n",
    "   - **Object Storage**: Data is stored as objects, including the data, metadata (descriptive information), and a unique identifier. Objects are stored in a flat hierarchy.\n",
    "   - **Block Storage**: Data is stored in fixed-sized blocks (e.g., 4KB, 8KB, 512B) and does not contain metadata or unique identifiers within the storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access Method**:\n",
    "   - **Object Storage**: Accessed via HTTP(S) with RESTful APIs, allowing metadata-based retrieval and management (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage).\n",
    "   - **Block Storage**: Accessed using block-level protocols such as iSCSI (Internet Small Computer System Interface) and is managed at the operating system level.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Cases**:\n",
    "   - **Object Storage**: Suitable for storing unstructured data like media files, backups, and large-scale web applications. Highly scalable for big data and cloud applications.\n",
    "   - **Block Storage**: Ideal for structured data, databases, virtual machines, and applications requiring low-latency, high-performance access.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Metadata and Searchability**:\n",
    "   - **Object Storage**: Provides rich metadata for each object, enabling efficient indexing and search capabilities.\n",
    "   - **Block Storage**: Lacks inherent metadata associated with individual blocks, making it less searchable at the storage level.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Efficiency**:\n",
    "   - **Object Storage**: Generally more cost-effective for storing large amounts of data due to its scalability and optimized storage techniques.\n",
    "   - **Block Storage**: Tends to be more expensive on a per-unit basis, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parallel Operations**:\n",
    "   - **Object Storage**: Enables concurrent operations on different objects, allowing for better parallelism and scalability.\n",
    "   - **Block Storage**: Limited parallelism as it operates on blocks and lacks the ability to directly access multiple blocks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transaction Management**:\n",
    "   - **Object Storage**: Often has built-in transaction support for atomic operations on objects, aiding in data consistency.\n",
    "   - **Block Storage**: Lacks inherent transaction support for atomic operations on blocks.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Object Storage**. The movies are not excessively large to require Block Storage, while they can indefinitely in number, also a simple key-value model is enough without requiring a file-system hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Block Storage**. Because it can handle large files and store more data than ordinary object storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Object Storage**. Backups are usually written once and rarely read. When data is read, partial access to each file is not essential. The client devices do not need to know the block composition of the object being stored. In fact, Apple [publicly confirmed](http://readwrite.com/2014/08/26/apple-icloud-amazon-web-services-hosting/) that backups data for iOS is stored on Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure."
